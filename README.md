This is a project created from the classes of the [Leonardo's Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/) (in PT-BR).

The app proposal is to give to user the control over your expenses by showing a list of transactions organized by date.

At the top of the main page there is a chart with the last seven days and the distribution of the expenses by the percentage that each day represents.

The user can add a new transaction by touching on the floating button at the bottom or in the button located at the app top bar.
